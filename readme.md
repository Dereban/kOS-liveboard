# kOS Liveboard Friends

We're playing a preconfigured KSP game with high affinity towards
using kOS. ideally for everything. If you want to play along, ask
a current player how to get the gamefolder. It comes with a game
save preconfigured, "kOS".

This repo is to be forked by players and sits in the gamefolder
rootdir. It commits:

- /Screenshots
- /Ships/Script/* (the kOS Archive)
- saves/kOS/Ships/*

Share code and learn from others. Post missions on YouTube if you
want/can. Install your own (balanced) mods if you feel like it.

It's worth the time to get kerboscript (.ks) syntax highlighting
in your favorite editor. Both Atom and Sublime 3 have these
packages; I've only done Atom personally and had no trouble.
